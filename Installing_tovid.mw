== Use the source ==

For platform-independent installation, you can use the source '''.tar.gz'''. First install all [[tovid dependencies]], to prevent potential problems.

Next, download {{LatestTarball}}. This tarball contains everything you need to run tovid and the GUI. Save this somewhere on your computer (for now, we'll assume it's saved in '''~/Downloads/''').

To extract the tarball, open a terminal window (such as XTerm, RXVT, or Konsole) and type the following commands, substituting for '''~/Downloads''' the path where you saved the .tar.gz:

 $ cd ~/Downloads
 $ tar -xzvf {{LatestRelease}}.tar.gz
 $ cd {{LatestRelease}}
 $ ./setup.py build

Then:

 $ sudo ./setup.py install
 or
 $ su -c './setup.py install'

depending on your distribution (Ubuntuers should use <code>sudo</code>). You will be prompted for the root password to install tovid system-wide. If you decide you don't want tovid installed anymore, run:

 $ sudo ./setup.py uninstall
 or
 $ su -c './setup.py uninstall'

from the original installation directory ('''~/Downloads/{{LatestRelease}}''') as root.


== Git ==

If you want to get the latest code directly from the development repository, you will need to install [http://git-scm.com/ git] and [http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net txt2tags] first. Assuming you want to put the tovid installer in '''~/Downloads''':

 $ cd ~/Downloads
 $ <nowiki>git clone https://github.com/tovid-suite/tovid.git</nowiki>
 $ cd tovid
 $ ./setup.py build
 $ ./setup.py build_docs
 $ ./setup.py build_tovid_init

then, as before:

 $ sudo ./setup.py install
 or
 $ su -c './setup.py install'

You should now have the latest version installed (bugs and all!) You can keep in sync with updates by doing:

 $ cd ~/Downloads/tovid
 $ git pull

followed by a re-install (<code>sudo ./setup.py install</code>). See the [http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial Official Git Tutorial] for more about dealing with git.

Check out the [[Development plans]] and [[Talk:Development plans|talk page]].


== Platform-specific instructions ==

Until the distribution-specific packages catch up to the latest release, it is recommended that you use [[#Git|git]] or the [[#Use the source | source tarball]] instead of an outdated package from your distribution.
